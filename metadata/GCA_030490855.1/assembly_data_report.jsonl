It is a passerine bird in the tit family, the Paridae (from Wikipedia). The species name is derived from its chick-a-dee-dee-dee call. This sample was collected from an adult female in the wild at the Rockefeller University Field Research Center, by Jean-Nicolas Audet and Melanie Couture, for a song and cognitive genetics study, and used to create at high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis, with funding support from HHMI.","organism":{"organismName":"Poecile atricapillus","taxId":48891},"title":"Animal sample from Poecile atricapillus (Black-capped chickadee) for VGP reference genome, bPoeAtr1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Rockefeller University Field Research Center, Millbrook, New York","isolate":"bPoeAtr1","lastUpdated":"2023-05-14T10:21:05.943","latLon":"41.767983 N 73.750862 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-05-14T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Poecile atricapillus (Black-capped chickadee) for VGP reference genome, bPoeAtr1"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-05-14T10:21:05.943"},"submissionDate":"2023-05-14T10:21:05.943","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_030490855.1","diploidRole":"haplotype_2","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_1","linkedAssembly":"GCA_030490865.1"}],"releaseDate":"2023-07-18","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Bionano Genomics DLS; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":38,"contigN50":8008306,"gcCount":"422351445","gcPercent":43.0,"genomeCoverage":"40.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":157,"numberOfContigs":397,"numberOfScaffolds":157,"scaffoldL50":4,"scaffoldN50":75865069,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":39,"totalSequenceLength":"987998379","totalUngappedLength":"987408166"},"currentAccession":"GCA_030490855.1","organism":{"commonName":"Black-capped chickadee","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bPoeAtr1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Poecile atricapillus","taxId":48891},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAUKOJ000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAUKOJ01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAUKOJ01"}}
