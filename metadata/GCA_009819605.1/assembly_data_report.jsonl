At one of its populations, located in the Banter See at Wilhelmshaven on the German North Sea coast (53.36N, 8.06S), it has been the subject of an individual-based study since 1992. Here, automated monitoring combined with non-invasive sampling methods allows the life-long and holistic assessment of colony presence, reproductive behaviour and performance, migratory behaviour and survival, as well as genetics and physiology. From this study population (Permit # AZ 3319-42502-04-16/2113, Funding : Max Planck Society, Grant ID : MPRG grant to ML), Sandra Bouwhuis, of the Institute of Avian Research, collected a sample from a female breeder. This sample was used to generate chromosomal level reference assembly as part of the G10K-VGP Project and the B10K Project.","organism":{"organismName":"Sterna hirundo","taxId":108405},"title":"Animal sample from Sterna hirundo"},"geoLocName":"Germany: Wilhelmshaven, Lower Saxonia","isolate":"bSteHir1","lastUpdated":"2024-02-02T17:02:20.520","latLon":"53.52998 N 8.11253 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2019-07-26T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Common tern tissue for G10K-VGP reference genome"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS20361218"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-07-26T08:03:19.655"},"submissionDate":"2019-07-26T08:03:19.653","tissue":"Blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_009819605.1","comments":"This assembly represents the principal haplotype of the diploid genome Sterna hirundo and includes the chromosomes.
