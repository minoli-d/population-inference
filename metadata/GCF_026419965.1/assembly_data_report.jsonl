The spermaceti is an oil sac that helps the whales focus sound. Like squid, pygmy sperm whales can produce a dark, ink-like liquid that helps them escape from predators. Pygmy sperm whales are found in temperate and tropical seas worldwide. They look very similar to dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima), making it very difficult to distinguish between the two species in the field. Little is known about both species because of limited information, and they are considered rare. This sample is from a juvenile female that was live-stranded in La Jolla, CA, but died after several weeks of attempted rehabilitation. The tissue sample was sent from Hubbs SeaWorld in San Diego to San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in 2017 in order to establish a fibroblast cell line that was banked in the SDZWA Frozen Zoo. The sample was later provided to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project. Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis. Hi-C data were provided by DNAzoo (from the same animal; DNAzoo.org assembly ID KogBre_v1_BIUU_HiC).
