The assembly process included the following sequence of steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Falcon-unzip, retained haplotig identification with purge_dups, 10X based scaffolding with scaff10x, BioNano hybrid-scaffolding, Hi-C based scaffolding with SALSA2, Arrow polishing, and two rounds of FreeBayes polishing. Finally, the assembly was analysed and manually improved using gEVAL. Chromosome-scale scaffolds were named based on a genetic map provided by the Jakobsen lab.","diploidRole":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_902167405.1"}],"releaseDate":"2019-07-16","submitter":"SC"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":622,"contigN50":278226,"gcCount":"266080369","gcPercent":45.5,"genomeCoverage":"83.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":3592,"numberOfContigs":3595,"numberOfScaffolds":3592,"scaffoldL50":621,"scaffoldN50":278683,"totalSequenceLength":"584119146","totalUngappedLength":"584119071"},"currentAccession":"GCA_902167395.1","organism":{"commonName":"Atlantic cod","organismName":"Gadus morhua","taxId":8049},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CABHMB000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CABHMB01","wgsProjectAccession":"CABHMB01"}}
