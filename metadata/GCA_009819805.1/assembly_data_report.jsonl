It is a highly social bird that breeds in large colonies. Its characteristic pink-orange color is caused by carotenoid pigements in the food (shrimp, plankton, algae, and crustaceans) they eat. This sample was collected by Mads Bertelsen from a female (leg band GZG) that lived at the Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark, and procured by Tom Gilbert to generate a chromosome level reference assembly as part of the G10K-VGP and B10K Projects.","organism":{"organismName":"Phoenicopterus ruber ruber","taxId":9218},"title":"Animal sample from Phoenicopterus ruber ruber"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Denmark: Copenhagen Zoo","isolate":"bPhoRub2","lastUpdated":"2023-08-21T12:08:19.213","latLon":"55.67278 N 12.52139 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2019-08-21T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"American flamingo sample for G10K-VGP reference genome"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18671885"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-08-21T10:38:05.250"},"subSpecies":"ruber","submissionDate":"2019-08-21T10:38:05.250","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_009819805.1","comments":"This assembly represents the alternate haplotype of the diploid genome Phoenicopterus ruber ruber.
