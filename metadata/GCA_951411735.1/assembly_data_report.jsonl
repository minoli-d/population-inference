The assembly is provided by EBP-Nor (https://www.ebpnor.org/). The assembly bSomMol1.h1.1 is based on 36x PacBio HiFi data, 52x Arima Hi-C data and generated by the EBP-Nor project. The assembly was filtered for adapters with HiFiAdapterFilt., assembled with hifiasm together with Hi-C data to generate a pair of haplotype-resolved assemblies. K-mers from the two assemblies were used to filter Hi-C reads to get two sets of reads to scaffold the assemblies (reads used to scaffold hap1 did not contain k-mers unique to hap2). YaHS was used for scaffolding. FCS-adaptor was used to remove putative adapters, before putative contaminants were removed with FCS-GX. No mitochondrial genomes were found in the data. Both W and Z chromosomes are found in hap1. The chromosomes confirmed by Hi-C data have been named in order of size.","refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2023-06-27","sequencingTech":"PACBIO_SMART, ILLUMINA","submitter":"EBP Norway"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":42,"contigN50":7862886,"gcCount":"528290470","gcPercent":44.0,"genomeCoverage":"36.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":468,"numberOfContigs":740,"numberOfScaffolds":468,"scaffoldL50":5,"scaffoldN50":77552753,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":34,"totalSequenceLength":"1205423405","totalUngappedLength":"1205369005"},"currentAccession":"GCA_951411735.1","organism":{"commonName":"common eider","organismName":"Somateria mollissima","taxId":76058},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CATOCB000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CATOCB01","wgsProjectAccession":"CATOCB01"}}
