Its closest modern relative is the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), which was hunted to extinction in the 18th century. The dugong spans the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the Indo-West Pacific (from Wikipedia entry). This sample is from a female inhabiting Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. The sample was collected by Janet M. Lanyon at the University of Queensland; Pacbio sequence data was generated at the Australian Genome Research Facility in the University of Queensland; Hi-C generated at the Ramaciotti Center for Genomics in the University University of New South Whales; the genome assembled at the Vertebrate Genome Lab at the Rockefeller University; and the curated at the curation team at the Sanger Institute. The genome was generated in part for and contributed to the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). The project was coordinate by Beth Shapiro, Carolyn J. Hogg, Olivier Fedrigo, and Erich D. Jarvis. Other contributions were from Katherine Belov, Katherine A. Farquharson, Diana Le Duc, Torsten Schoneberg, D. Neve Baker, and Merly Escalona. We also acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land and water, the Quandamooka people, who care for the yangang (dugong) and the country. We pay our respects to their elders past and present.","organism":{"organismName":"Dugong dugon","taxId":29137},"title":"Animal sample from Dugong dugon (dugon) for VGP genome, mDugDug1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Australia: Moreton Bay, Queensland","isolate":"mDugDug1","lastUpdated":"2023-02-08T14:51:04.330","latLon":"27.15148032 S 153.0415985 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-02-08T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Dugong dugon (dugon) for VGP genome, mDugDug1"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-02-08T14:51:04.330"},"submissionDate":"2023-02-08T14:51:04.330","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_030035585.1","diploidRole":"haplotype_1","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_2","linkedAssembly":"GCA_030020955.1"}],"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2023-05-18","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Dovetail OmniC","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":17,"contigN50":57632671,"gcCount":"1283782662","gcPercent":40.5,"genomeCoverage":"32.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":198,"numberOfContigs":294,"numberOfScaffolds":198,"scaffoldL50":9,"scaffoldN50":140670990,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":24,"totalSequenceLength":"3158488110","totalUngappedLength":"3158468910"},"currentAccession":"GCA_030035585.1","organism":{"commonName":"dugong","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"mDugDug1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Dugong dugon","taxId":29137},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JASCZL000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JASCZL01","wgsProjectAccession":"JASCZL01"}}
