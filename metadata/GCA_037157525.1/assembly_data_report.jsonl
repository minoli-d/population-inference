It lives within a relative homogenous environment within perennial forests, low forests, and a band of xeric vegetation (from Wikipedia entry). This sample of a female individual found in Lamanai, Orange Walk District, Belize, was procured by Nancy Simmons and Sonja Vernes to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Bat Biology Foundation and the Bat1K project. Sequencing was conducted at Paratus Sciences and genome assembly was conducted at the Vertebrate Genome Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Erich D. Jarvis, Giulio Formenti, and Jennifer Balacco.","organism":{"organismName":"Molossus alvarezi","taxId":1552295},"title":"Animal sample from Molossus alvarezi (Alvarez's mastiff bat) for Bat1K reference genome, in collaboration with BBF and VGP, mMolAlv2"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Belize: Orange Walk District, Lamanai","isolate":"mMolAlv2","lastUpdated":"2024-04-19T17:05:20.510","latLon":"17.76639 N 88.65225 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2024-02-20T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Molossus alvarezi (Alvarez's mastiff bat) for Bat1K reference genome, in collaboration with BBF and VGP, mMolAlv2"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS21073825"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2024-02-20T22:20:04.939"},"submissionDate":"2024-02-20T22:20:04.937","tissue":"liver, muscle, heart, spleen, pancreas, kidney"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_037157525.1","diploidRole":"haplotype_1","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_2","linkedAssembly":"GCA_037176705.1"}],"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Bat1K Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":15,"contigN50":63410948,"gcCount":"1048378392","gcPercent":42.5,"genomeCoverage":"51.5x","numberOfComponentSequences":325,"numberOfContigs":405,"numberOfOrganelles":1,"numberOfScaffolds":325,"scaffoldL50":9,"scaffoldN50":112651663,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":24,"totalSequenceLength":"2478667944","totalUngappedLength":"2478655244"},"currentAccession":"GCA_037157525.1","organelleInfo":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Bat1K Project","totalSeqLength":"16773"}],"organism":{"commonName":"Alvarez's mastiff bat","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"mMolAlv2","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Molossus alvarezi","taxId":1552295},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JBAWUI000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JBAWUI01","wgsProjectAccession":"JBAWUI01"}}
