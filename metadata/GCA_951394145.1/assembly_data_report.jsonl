The assembly is provided by EBP-Nor (https://www.ebpnor.org/). The assembly mRanTar1.hap2.1 is based on 32x PacBio HiFi data, 56x Arima Hi-C data and generated by the EBP-Nor project. The assembly was filtered for adapters with HiFiAdapterFilt., assembled with hifiasm together with Hi-C data to generate a pair of haplotype-resolved assemblies. K-mers from the two assemblies were used to filter Hi-C reads to get two sets of reads to scaffold the assemblies (reads used to scaffold hap1 did not contain k-mers unique to hap2). YaHS was used for scaffolding. FCS-adaptor was used to remove putative adapters, before putative contaminants were removed with FCS-GX. No mitochondrial genomes were found in the data, so NC_007703.1 was added to hap1 for completeness. Both X and Y chromosomes are found in hap1. The chromosomes confirmed by Hi-C data have been named in order of size.","releaseDate":"2023-05-13","sequencingTech":"PACBIO_SMART, ILLUMINA","submitter":"EBP Norway"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":35,"contigN50":25533000,"gcCount":"1209131943","gcPercent":42.5,"genomeCoverage":"32.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":1291,"numberOfContigs":1497,"numberOfScaffolds":1291,"scaffoldL50":17,"scaffoldN50":64924600,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":33,"totalSequenceLength":"2829814183","totalUngappedLength":"2829786122"},"currentAccession":"GCA_951394145.1","organism":{"commonName":"Svalbard reindeer","organismName":"Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus","taxId":3082113},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CATOBB000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CATOBB01","wgsProjectAccession":"CATOBB01"}}
