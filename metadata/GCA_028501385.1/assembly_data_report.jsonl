They are found across the northern coasts of the Atlantic, from Canada to Greenland, and on the Pacific side from Alaska to the coast of Siberia. This sample is from a female caught on Middleton Island, Alaska USA, collected by Kyle Elliott, coordinated by Diego Rubolini and Vicki Friesen, and used to generate a trio-based high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Parent samples were named bRisTri2 (mother) and bRisTri3 (father). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Rissa tridactyla","taxId":75485},"title":"Animal sample from Rissa tridactyla (Black-legged kittiwake) for VGP genome bRisTri1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Middleton Island, Alaska","isolate":"bRisTri1","lastUpdated":"2022-12-07T20:19:04.412","latLon":"59.43 N 146.34 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2022-12-07T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Rissa tridactyla (Black-legged kittiwake) for VGP genome bRisTri1"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2022-12-07T20:19:04.412"},"submissionDate":"2022-12-07T20:19:04.412","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_028501385.1","diploidRole":"maternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"paternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_028500815.1"}],"releaseDate":"2023-02-10","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Bionano DLS; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":22,"contigN50":18169445,"gcCount":"565693933","gcPercent":44.5,"genomeCoverage":"33.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":733,"numberOfContigs":956,"numberOfScaffolds":733,"scaffoldL50":5,"scaffoldN50":82691832,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":30,"totalSequenceLength":"1268441171","totalUngappedLength":"1267801299"},"currentAccession":"GCA_028501385.1","organism":{"commonName":"black-legged kittiwake","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bRisTri1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Rissa tridactyla","taxId":75485},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAPUFH000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAPUFH01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAPUFH01"}}
