The project was funded by grants to Professor Neil Gemmell from the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund and the University of Otago.","organism":{"organismName":"Notolabrus celidotus","taxId":1203425},"title":"Animal sample from Notolabrus celidotus"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"New Zealand: Tauranga","isolate":"fNotCel1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-23T08:25:19.407","latLon":"37.39219 S 176.09222 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2019-08-22T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"New Zealand spotty wrasse sample for G10K-VGP reference genome"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18698475"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-08-22T21:18:04.362"},"submissionDate":"2019-08-22T21:18:04.360","tissue":"liver"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_009762535.1","comments":"Due to size limit cut off, this submission does not include a 137 bp scaffold_651_arrow_ctg1, which does not match any sequence in the current NCBI database, but was assembled in this species.
