Its range extends from tropical to subtropical seas around the world. They migrate long distances between feeding regions and hatching beaches. Chelonia mydas are currently endangered of becoming extinct (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) and is protected from exploitation in most countries. This sample originated from the Mediterranean Sea, was collected by the Israel's Sea Turtle Rescue Center, and was used to generate a chromosome level reference genome as part of the G10K-VGP Project.","organism":{"organismName":"Chelonia mydas","taxId":8469},"title":"Model organism or animal sample from Chelonia mydas"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Israel: Mediterranean Sea","isolate":"rCheMyd1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-23T15:18:48.473","latLon":"31.814194 N 34.753376 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2019-08-20T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Green Sea turtle sample for G10K-VGP reference genome"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18701202"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-08-20T21:52:05.341"},"submissionDate":"2019-08-20T21:52:05.340","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_015220195.2","diploidRole":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_015237465.2"}],"releaseDate":"2021-07-15","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel I CLR; Illumina NovaSeq; Arima Genomics Hi-C; Bionano Genomics DLS","submitter":"G10K"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":1134,"contigN50":454332,"gcCount":"836999938","gcPercent":44.0,"genomeCoverage":"60.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":6737,"numberOfContigs":6797,"numberOfScaffolds":6737,"scaffoldL50":1132,"scaffoldN50":455478,"totalSequenceLength":"1896142417","totalUngappedLength":"1895288375"},"currentAccession":"GCA_015220195.2","organism":{"commonName":"Green sea turtle","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"rCheMyd1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Chelonia mydas","taxId":8469},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JADCQN000000000.2","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JADCQN02","wgsProjectAccession":"JADCQN02"}}
