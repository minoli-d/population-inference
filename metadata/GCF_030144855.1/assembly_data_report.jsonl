It may be distinguished from other stingrays in the area by its relatively elongated snout. A homotypic synonomous species name is Dasyatis sabina. This sample is from a male in Gulf of Mexico, collected by Dean Grubbs, coordinated by Gavin Naylor at the University of Florida, and used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Hypanus sabinus","taxId":79690},"title":"Animal sample from Hypanus sabinus (Atlantic stingray) for VGP genome, sHypSab1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Gulf of Mexico, near St Vincent Island, Florida","isolate":"sHypSab1","lastUpdated":"2023-10-30T12:57:19.957","latLon":"29.51074 N 85.142204 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-01-15T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Hypanus sabinus (Atlantic stingray) for VGP genome, sHypSab1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS19335842"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-01-15T17:59:04.161"},"submissionDate":"2023-01-15T17:59:04.160","tissue":"spleen"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_030144855.1","comments":"Chromosomes X1, X2 and Y were found based on coverage data.
