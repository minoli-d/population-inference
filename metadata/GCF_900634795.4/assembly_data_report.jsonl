Scaffolding and curation also integrated\n183x Illumina HiSeqX data generated from a 10X Genomics Chromium library and single-enzyme BioNano Irys data, both from a separate individual (fBetSpl1, sample SAMEA104381745). All data was generated at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. An initial PacBio assembly of fBetSpl5 was made using Falcon-unzip, and retained haplotigs were identified using purge_haplotigs. The primary contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data from fBetSpl1 with scaff10x. After using the PacBio data to gap fill with PBJelly and polish with Arrow, the assembly was polished again using the fBetSpl5 Illumina data and freebayes. Finally, the assembly was manually improved using gEVAL to correct mis-joins and improve concordance with the BioNano data. By aligning with the existing Betta splendens assembly (GCA_003650155.1) and medaka, we were able to order and orient our scaffolds and place onto chromosomes. Chromosomes are named by synteny to medaka.","pairedAssembly":{"accession":"GCA_900634795.4","onlyRefseq":"chromosome MT","status":"current"},"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2023-03-10","sequencingTech":"PacBio,Illumina","submitter":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":46,"contigN50":2574972,"gcCount":"193454353","gcPercent":45.5,"genomeCoverage":"48.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":35,"numberOfContigs":351,"numberOfOrganelles":1,"numberOfScaffolds":35,"scaffoldL50":9,"scaffoldN50":19821211,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":21,"totalSequenceLength":"426984265","totalUngappedLength":"426952799"},"currentAccession":"GCF_900634795.4","organelleInfo":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Wellcome Sanger Institute","totalSeqLength":"16980"}],"organism":{"commonName":"Siamese fighting fish","organismName":"Betta splendens","taxId":158456},"pairedAccession":"GCA_900634795.4","sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_REFSEQ","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CAAAFW000000000.4","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CAAAFW04","wgsProjectAccession":"CAAAFW04"}}
