The assembly is provided by EBP-Nor (https://www.ebpnor.org/). The assembly mRanTar1.h1.1 is based on 32x PacBio HiFi data, 56x Arima Hi-C data and generated by the EBP-Nor project. The assembly was filtered for adapters with HiFiAdapterFilt., assembled with hifiasm together with Hi-C data to generate a pair of haplotype-resolved assemblies. K-mers from the two assemblies were used to filter Hi-C reads to get two sets of reads to scaffold the assemblies (reads used to scaffold hap1 did not contain k-mers unique to hap2). YaHS was used for scaffolding. FCS-adaptor was used to remove putative adapters, before putative contaminants were removed with FCS-GX. No mitochondrial genomes were found in the data, so NC_007703.1 was added to hap1 for completeness. Both X and Y chromosomes are found in hap1. The chromosomes confirmed by Hi-C data have been named in order of size.","refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2023-04-20","sequencingTech":"PACBIO_SMART, ILLUMINA","submitter":"EBP Norway"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":39,"contigN50":22482685,"gcCount":"1267145740","gcPercent":42.5,"genomeCoverage":"32.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":1395,"numberOfContigs":1662,"numberOfOrganelles":1,"numberOfScaffolds":1395,"scaffoldL50":16,"scaffoldN50":69829200,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":36,"totalSequenceLength":"2971153391","totalUngappedLength":"2971113697"},"currentAccession":"GCA_949782905.1","organelleInfo":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"EBP Norway","totalSeqLength":"16362"}],"organism":{"commonName":"Svalbard reindeer","organismName":"Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus","taxId":3082113},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CATKSN000000000.2","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CATKSN02","wgsProjectAccession":"CATKSN02"}}
