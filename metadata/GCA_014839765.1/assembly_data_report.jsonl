During migration, they can metabolize up to 19% of their breast muscle and 39% of their digestive tract. They also have a rich diverse song. This sample was collected by Julia Slezacek of a female from Ponza Island, Italy, and procured for studies on migration by Silvia Fuselli, Steve Smith, and Leonida Fusani, to generate a chromosome level reference assembly as part of the G10K-VGP Project.","organism":{"organismName":"Sylvia borin","taxId":73324},"title":"Animal sample from Sylvia borin"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Italy: Ponza Island","isolate":"bSylBor1","lastUpdated":"2024-02-02T17:03:21.713","latLon":"40.9293 N 12.949173 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2019-08-22T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Garden warbler sample for G10K-VGP reference genome"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS20361228"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-08-22T00:39:05.619"},"submissionDate":"2019-08-22T00:39:05.617","tissue":"isolated red blood cells"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_014839765.1","comments":"This assembly represents the alternate haplotype of the diploid genome Sylvia borin.
