Both are social herbivores with grey skin, but differ in the size and color of their tusks and in the shape and size of their ears and skulls. Both species are at heavy risk of extinction, where as of 2021, the bush elephant is endangered and the forest elephant is critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List (modified from Wikipedia entry). This sample of Loxodonta africana was collected from a male calf born in Louisville Kentucky Zoo, the endothelial cells derived from the umbilical cord by Virginia Pearson, cultured by Austin Bow and Xochitl Ambriz Pena, and coordinated by Eriona Hysolli, Austin Bow, Sara Ord, and Ben Lamm of Colossal Biosciences and Kathleen Horan of Rockefeller University. The cultured cells were used to create a high-quality reference genome for Colossal Biosciences mammoth project and the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Loxodonta africana","taxId":9785},"title":"Animal sample from Loxodonta africana (African bush elephant) for VGP genome, mLoxAfr1"},"devStage":"juvenile","geoLocName":"USA: Louisville Zoo, Kentucky","isolate":"mLoxAfr1","lastUpdated":"2024-08-24T12:27:21.010","latLon":"38.2057 N 85.7071 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-01-16T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Loxodonta africana (African bush elephant) for VGP genome, mLoxAfr1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22448717"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-01-16T17:17:04.102"},"submissionDate":"2023-01-16T17:17:04.103","tissue":"Original tissue source of cells is from umbilical cord"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_030014295.1","pairedAssembly":{"accession":"GCA_030014295.1","onlyGenbank":"chromosome MT","status":"current"},"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2023-05-16","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Bionano DLS; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":15,"contigN50":82653632,"gcCount":"1458935897","gcPercent":41.0,"genomeCoverage":"43.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":879,"numberOfContigs":1110,"numberOfScaffolds":879,"scaffoldL50":11,"scaffoldN50":119600562,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":29,"totalSequenceLength":"3540876381","totalUngappedLength":"3537187813"},"currentAccession":"GCF_030014295.1","organism":{"commonName":"African savanna elephant","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"mLoxAfr1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Loxodonta africana","taxId":9785},"pairedAccession":"GCA_030014295.1","sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_REFSEQ","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JASCQR000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JASCQR01","wgsProjectAccession":"JASCQR01"}}
