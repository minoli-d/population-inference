The common name comes from the large, white-margined black spot behind each pectoral fin, reminiscent of military epaulettes. they are nocturnal and walk with their fins (from Wikipedia entries). This juvenile male is from trio of samples (parents) breed and collected to create a high-quality reference genome for both maternal and paternal haplotypes. The juvenile was bred in captivity. Breeding and sample collection was conducted by Frank Tulenko, in coordination with Gavin Naylor, Peter Currie, and Olivier Fedrigo. Spleen from the male was used to create high-quality reference genome assemblies of each haplotype. Genome sequencing and assembly was coordinated by Erich D. Jarvis, and Olivier Fedrigo at the Rockefeller University Vertebrate Genome Lab, and Shawn Burgess, Jim Mullikin, and Adam Phillippy at NIH, as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP).","organism":{"organismName":"Hemiscyllium ocellatum","taxId":170820},"title":"Animal sample from Hemiscyllium ocellatum (epaulette shark) for VGP genome, sHemOce1"},"devStage":"juvenile","geoLocName":"Australia: Clayton, Melbourne, Victoria","isolate":"sHemOce1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-23T20:00:20.130","latLon":"37.9105 S 145.1293 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2021-10-24T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Hemiscyllium ocellatum (epaulette shark) for VGP genome, sHemOce1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18706220"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2021-10-24T18:53:03.542"},"submissionDate":"2021-10-24T18:53:03.543","tissue":"spleen"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_020745765.1","diploidRole":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_020745735.1"}],"releaseDate":"2021-11-05","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II CLR; Illumina NovaSeq; Bionano Genomics DLS; Arima Genomics Hi-C v1","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":107,"contigN50":7868162,"gcCount":"1738457816","gcPercent":43.0,"genomeCoverage":"148.6x","numberOfComponentSequences":4000,"numberOfContigs":7549,"numberOfScaffolds":4000,"scaffoldL50":23,"scaffoldN50":56110228,"totalSequenceLength":"4149461884","totalUngappedLength":"4066097657"},"currentAccession":"GCA_020745765.1","organism":{"commonName":"epaulette shark","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"sHemOce1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Hemiscyllium ocellatum","taxId":170820},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAJGRZ000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAJGRZ01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAJGRZ01"}}
