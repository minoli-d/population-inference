Like other species of spadefoot toads, they get their name from a spade-like projections on their hind legs which allow them to dig into sandy soils (from Wikipedia entry). This sample from a female collected in Anton, Colorado. The sample was procured by Karin Pfenning with coordination help from Andrew Crawford and used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Spea bombifrons","taxId":233779},"title":"Animal sample from Spea bombifrons (plains spadefoot toad) for VGP reference genome, aSpeBom1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Anton, Colorado","isolate":"aSpeBom1","lastUpdated":"2022-12-14T09:30:06.685","latLon":"39.74511 N 103.19081 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2022-05-14T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Spea bombifrons (plains spadefoot toad) for VGP reference genome, aSpeBom1"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2022-05-14T11:06:04.618"},"submissionDate":"2022-05-14T11:06:04.616","tissue":"muscle"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_027382365.2","comments":"In January 2023 1 sequence was suppressed because it was found to be a contaminant.","diploidRole":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_027358695.2"}],"releaseDate":"2022-12-27","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":115,"contigN50":2001516,"gcCount":"314566508","gcPercent":40.0,"genomeCoverage":"35.5x","numberOfComponentSequences":1516,"numberOfContigs":1516,"totalSequenceLength":"785569511","totalUngappedLength":"785569511"},"currentAccession":"GCA_027382365.2","organism":{"commonName":"plains spadefoot toad","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"aSpeBom1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Spea bombifrons","taxId":233779},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAPZAM000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAPZAM01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAPZAM01"}}
