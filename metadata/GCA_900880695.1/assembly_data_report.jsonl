An initial PacBio assembly was made using Falcon-unzip, and retained haplotigs were identified using purge_haplotigs. The primary contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data with scaff10x, then scaffolded further using the Hi-C data with SALSA2. Polishing and gap-filling of both the primary scaffolds and haplotigs was performed using the PacBio reads and Arrow, followed by two rounds of Illumina polishing using the 10X data and freebayes. Finally, the assembly was manually improved using gEVAL to correct mis-joins and improve concordance with the raw data. Chromosomes are named according to synteny with the GCA_003309015.1 assembly of Sparus aurata.","diploidRole":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_900880675.2"}],"releaseDate":"2019-07-11","submitter":"SC"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":1184,"contigN50":152708,"gcCount":"280520292","gcPercent":42.0,"genomeCoverage":"56.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":7239,"numberOfContigs":7241,"numberOfScaffolds":7239,"scaffoldL50":1184,"scaffoldN50":152836,"totalSequenceLength":"668417842","totalUngappedLength":"668417310"},"currentAccession":"GCA_900880695.1","organism":{"commonName":"gilthead seabream","organismName":"Sparus aurata","taxId":8175},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CAAHFD000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CAAHFD01","wgsProjectAccession":"CAAHFD01"}}
