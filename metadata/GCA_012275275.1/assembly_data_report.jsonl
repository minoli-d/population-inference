It was the first parrot species where the vocal learning brain pathways was discovered, and found to uniquely have a core song learning system surrounded by a shell learning system, with the core similar to songbirds and hummingbirds (also vocal learners) and the shell unique to parrots. The brain pathways have convergent changes in gene regulation shared with human speech brain pathways. This sample was collected as part of a trio of samples (daughter in this case), by Timothy Wright and Justin Apodaca, supported by Erich D. Jarvis, and used to generate a high-quality reference genome of he daughter as part of the G10K-VGP Project and G10K Project.","organism":{"organismName":"Melopsittacus undulatus","taxId":13146},"title":"Animal sample from Melopsittacus undulatus"},"devStage":"juvenile","geoLocName":"USA: New Mexico State University","isolate":"bMelUnd1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-22T13:47:19.547","latLon":"32.278282 N 106.74994 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2019-08-22T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Budgerigar sample for G10K-VGP reference genome daughter of trio"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18688280"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-08-22T20:55:05.579"},"submissionDate":"2019-08-22T20:55:05.577","tissue":"Blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_012275275.1","comments":"This assembly represents the paternal alternate haplotype of the diploid genome Melopsittacus undulatus.
