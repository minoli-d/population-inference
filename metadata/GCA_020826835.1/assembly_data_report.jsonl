As of 2021 it is considered critically endangered. This trio of samples was collected to create a high-quality reference genome for two haplotypes. The female (mDicBic1) called Mupani who the reference genome was generated, was born in the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center in Texas. Her mother Coco (mDicBic2) and father (mDicBic3), originally from Zimbabwe. Sample collection was conducted by Budhan Pukazhenthi, in coordination with Klaus-Peter Koepfli. Blood from these samples were used to create high-quality reference genome assemblies of each haplotype, coordinated by Erich Jarvis and Olivier Fedrigo, at the Rockefeller University Vertebrate Genome Lab, as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP).
