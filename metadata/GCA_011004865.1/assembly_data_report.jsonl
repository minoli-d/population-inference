The Crowned crane performs an interesting display when breeding that involves dancing, bowing, and jumping, as well as a booming call that involves inflation of a red gular sac on its throat (description from the Avian Phylogenomics Project http://gigadb.org/dataset/101017). This sample was collected by Mads Bertelsen from a female that lived at the Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark and was procured by Tom Gilbert to generate a chromosome level reference assembly as part of the G10K-VGP and B10K Projects.","organism":{"organismName":"Balearica regulorum gibbericeps","taxId":100784},"title":"Animal sample from Balearica regulorum gibbericeps"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Denmark: Copenhagen Zoo","isolate":"bBalReg1","lastUpdated":"2023-07-21T17:31:53.183","latLon":"55.67278 N 12.52139 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2019-08-21T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Grey crowned-crane for G10K-VGP trio reference genome"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18391120"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-08-21T10:50:05.247"},"subSpecies":"gibbericeps","submissionDate":"2019-08-21T10:50:05.247","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_011004865.1","comments":"This assembly represents the alternate haplotype of the diploid genome Balearica regulorum gibbericeps.
