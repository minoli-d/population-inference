It is recognized by the stripped black and white ring circles on its tail. They have been studied for the communication and cognitive abilities. They are the most popular lemurs in zoos worldwide. They are currently endangered in the wild (IUCN red list). This sample was collected by Mads Bertelsen from a male that lived at the Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark, procured by Tom Gilbert, and supported by Tomas Marques-Bonet at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, for primate evolution investigations, to generate a chromosome level reference assembly as part of the G10K-VGP Project.","organism":{"organismName":"Lemur catta","taxId":9447},"title":"Animal sample from Lemur catta"},"devStage":"juvenile","geoLocName":"Denmark: Copenhagen Zoo","isolate":"mLemCat1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-23T23:31:12.617","latLon":"55.67278 N 12.52139 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2019-08-22T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Ring-tailed lemur sample for G10K-VGP reference genome"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18707945"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-08-22T12:55:05.232"},"submissionDate":"2019-08-22T12:55:05.230","tissue":"spleen"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_020740605.2","pairedAssembly":{"accession":"GCA_020740605.1","status":"current"},"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2021-11-04","sequencingTech":"Pacbio Sequel II CCS; 10X Genomics linked reads; Bionano Genomics DLS; Arima Genomics v1 Hi-C","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":20,"contigN50":32529614,"gcCount":"927290679","gcPercent":41.5,"genomeCoverage":"20.8x","numberOfComponentSequences":184,"numberOfContigs":394,"numberOfOrganelles":1,"numberOfScaffolds":184,"scaffoldL50":9,"scaffoldN50":102162704,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":29,"totalSequenceLength":"2245584463","totalUngappedLength":"2241942842"},"currentAccession":"GCF_020740605.2","organelleInfo":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project","totalSeqLength":"17086"}],"organism":{"commonName":"Ring-tailed lemur","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"mLemCat1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Lemur catta","taxId":9447},"pairedAccession":"GCA_020740605.1","sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_REFSEQ","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAJGPY000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAJGPY01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAJGPY01"}}
