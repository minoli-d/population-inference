Due to over hunting, they were once thought extinct by the late1890s, until 50 years later a small isolated population was found. The is now an active breeding program for their conservation. This juvenile female is from trio of samples (parents) breed and collected to create a high-quality reference genome for both maternal and paternal haplotypes. The juvenile was bred in captivity. Sample collection was conducted by Glen Greaves, in a projected coordinated and supported by Lara Urban, Andrew Digby, Daryl Eason, Deidre Vercoe, and Takahe Recovery Programme. Blood from the female was used to create high-quality reference genome assemblies of each haplotype. Genome sequencing and assembly was coordinated by Erich D. Jarvis and Olivier Fedrigo at the Rockefeller University Vertebrate Genome Lab, and as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) and for conservation research.","organism":{"organismName":"Porphyrio hochstetteri","taxId":439704},"title":"Animal sample from Porphyrio hochstetteri (takahe) for VGP reference genome, bPorHoc1"},"devStage":"juvenile","geoLocName":"New Zealand: Burwood","isolate":"bPorHoc1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-16T14:27:19.467","latLon":"43.499998 S 172.6999972 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2021-10-24T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Porphyrio hochstetteri (takahe) for VGP reference genome, bPorHoc1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18622764"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2021-10-24T23:03:03.709"},"submissionDate":"2021-10-24T23:03:03.710","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_020800305.1","diploidRole":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_020801775.1"}],"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2021-11-08","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Bionano Genomics DLS; Illumina HiSeq; Arima Genomics Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":31,"contigN50":13461271,"gcCount":"553309262","gcPercent":43.5,"genomeCoverage":"36.8x","numberOfComponentSequences":173,"numberOfContigs":500,"numberOfOrganelles":1,"numberOfScaffolds":173,"scaffoldL50":5,"scaffoldN50":71566193,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":34,"totalSequenceLength":"1270277365","totalUngappedLength":"1264961116"},"currentAccession":"GCA_020800305.1","organelleInfo":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project","totalSeqLength":"16988"}],"organism":{"commonName":"South Island takahe","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bPorHoc1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Porphyrio hochstetteri","taxId":439704},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAJHSY000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAJHSY01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAJHSY01"}}
