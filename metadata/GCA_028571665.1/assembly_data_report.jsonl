Hyraxes means shrewmouse, derived from Greek. Hyraxes retain or have redeveloped a number of primitive mammalian characteristics, including poorly developed internal temperature regulation (modified from Wikipedia entry). This sample is from a male, bred in captivity, in Opel Zoo, Kronberg, Germany. This sample was collected by Gudrun Wibbelt, and the project coordinated by Camila Mazzoni, Sylke Winkler, Gene Myers, and Erich D. Jarvis to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Dresden Genome Center at the Max Planck Institute, led by Gene Myers and Sylke Winkler.","organism":{"organismName":"Heterohyrax brucei","taxId":77598},"title":"Animal sample from Heterohyrax brucei (yellow-spotted rock hyrax) for VGP genome, mHetBru1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Germany: Opel Zoo, Kronberg im Taunus","isolate":"mHetBru1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-24T01:38:36.380","latLon":"50.183333 N 8.486389 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-02-04T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Heterohyrax brucei (yellow-spotted rock hyrax) for VGP genome, mHetBru1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18708107"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-02-04T12:33:04.726"},"submissionDate":"2023-02-04T12:33:04.727","tissue":"spleen"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_028571665.1","comments":"The mHetBru1 assembly is characterized by telocentric repeats.
