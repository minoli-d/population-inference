Its breeding range spans Asia and Europe, and it is a member of the hierofalcon complex. This sample was procured by Farooq Omar Al-Ajli and used to generate a high-quality reference genome in a collaboration between Qatar Falcon Genome Project (QFGP) and the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). The project was coordinated by Farooq Al-Ajli as a part of large conservation study (Qatar Falcon Genome Project), and funded by KATARA Cultural Village and Al-Gannas Qatari Society, Qatar. Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) by Farooq Omar Al-Ajli at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.
