The assembly process included the following sequence of steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Falcon-unzip, retained haplotig identification with Purge Haplotigs, 10X based scaffolding with scaff10x, BioNano hybrid-scaffolding, Hi-C based scaffolding with SALSA2, Arrow polishing, and two rounds of FreeBayes polishing. The mitochondrial assembly was produced at The Rockefeller University using mitoVGP. Finally, the assembly was analysed and manually improved using gEVAL. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data have been named in order of size.","diploidRole":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_901001175.1"}],"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2021-04-24","submitter":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":489,"contigN50":3216284,"gcCount":"2346559167","gcPercent":44.5,"genomeCoverage":"43.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":1329,"numberOfContigs":4900,"numberOfOrganelles":1,"numberOfScaffolds":1329,"scaffoldL50":4,"scaffoldN50":486875112,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":19,"totalSequenceLength":"5319222779","totalUngappedLength":"5285266948"},"currentAccession":"GCA_901001135.2","organelleInfo":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Wellcome Sanger Institute","totalSeqLength":"16407"}],"organism":{"commonName":"two-lined caecilian","organismName":"Rhinatrema bivittatum","taxId":194408},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CAAJIB000000000.2","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CAAJIB02","wgsProjectAccession":"CAAJIB02"}}
