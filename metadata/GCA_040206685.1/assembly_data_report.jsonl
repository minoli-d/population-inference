The tail is one of two distinctive anatomical features adapting the species to life in fast-flowing streams. The two species are the only North American frog species that reproduce by internal fertilization (from Wikipedia entry). This sample of a male individual found at the Luckiamute River in Polk County, Oregon, USA, was coordinated by Gwendolynn W. Bury (Oregon State University) and R. Bruce Bury (U.S. Geological Survey) to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). The individual was collected by Mark Leppin (Oregon State University) under Oregon Scientific Permit #114-20, and the sample was dissected by Adam Leache (University of Washington). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genome Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Erich D. Jarvis, Giulio Formenti, and Jennifer Balacco.","organism":{"organismName":"Ascaphus truei","taxId":8439},"title":"Animal sample from Ascaphus truei (tailed frog) for VGP reference genome, aAscTru1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Polk County, Oregon","isolate":"aAscTru1","lastUpdated":"2024-08-13T13:28:21.737","latLon":"44.796144 N 123.527922 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2024-05-01T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Ascaphus truei (tailed frog) for VGP reference genome, aAscTru1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22326089"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2024-05-01T23:44:10.825"},"submissionDate":"2024-05-01T23:44:10.827","tissue":"kidney, liver"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_040206685.1","comments":"The following regions are of uncertain order and orientation: Haplotype 1 Chromosome 1 - approx. 267.5-307 Mbp; Haplotype 1 Chromosome 3 - approx. 132-186 Mbp; Haplotype 1 Chromosome 4 - approx. 144-184 Mbp.","diploidRole":"haplotype_1","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_2","linkedAssembly":"GCA_040206675.1"}],"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2024-06-17","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":1005,"contigN50":981472,"gcCount":"1671516604","gcPercent":45.0,"genomeCoverage":"29.4x","numberOfComponentSequences":3549,"numberOfContigs":9569,"numberOfScaffolds":3549,"scaffoldL50":4,"scaffoldN50":424004025,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":23,"totalSequenceLength":"3722616900","totalUngappedLength":"3721412824"},"currentAccession":"GCA_040206685.1","organism":{"commonName":"tailed frog","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"aAscTru1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Ascaphus truei","taxId":8439},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JBDGIJ000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JBDGIJ01","wgsProjectAccession":"JBDGIJ01"}}
