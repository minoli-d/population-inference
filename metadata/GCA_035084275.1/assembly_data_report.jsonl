This sample is from a male individual collected from San Juan Island in the San Juan Channel of Washington State, by Karly Cohen of Friday Harbor Labs, and coordinated by Gavin Naylor to be used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D.
