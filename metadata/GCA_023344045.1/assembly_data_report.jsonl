The species has a circumpolar distribution inhabiting sub-arctic and arctic regions in addition to a few more southern alpine regions. This sample is being included in the Vertebrate Genomes Project. The sample was collected by Kristinn P. Magnusson who also provided the finances for the project through his Icelandic Research Fund grant 206529-052, together with Jacob Hoglund with grant VR 2018-04635. The genome was assembled and scaffolded by Patrik Rodin-Morch with support from Ignas Bunikis and Giulio Formenti. Curation was performed by Alan Tracey at the Welcome Sanger Institute.","organism":{"organismName":"Lagopus muta","taxId":64668},"title":"Animal sample from Lagopus muta (Rock ptarmigan), a VGP reference genome, bLagMut1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Iceland: Husavik, NE","isolate":"bLagMut1","lastUpdated":"2022-05-09T19:16:45.113","latLon":"66.088900 N 17.264700 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2022-01-20T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Lagopus muta (Rock ptarmigan), a VGP reference genome, bLagMut1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS12953177"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2022-01-20T18:04:08.159"},"submissionDate":"2022-01-20T17:32:03.887","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_023344045.1","diploidRole":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_023343835.1"}],"releaseDate":"2022-05-12","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Dovetail genomics Hi-C; Illumina NovaSeq","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":414,"contigN50":619110,"gcCount":"383751291","gcPercent":41.5,"genomeCoverage":"57.8x","numberOfComponentSequences":3212,"numberOfContigs":3225,"numberOfScaffolds":3212,"scaffoldL50":413,"scaffoldN50":619935,"totalSequenceLength":"923340374","totalUngappedLength":"923339054"},"currentAccession":"GCA_023344045.1","organism":{"commonName":"rock ptarmigan","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bLagMut1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Lagopus muta","taxId":64668},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAMCCU000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAMCCU01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAMCCU01"}}
