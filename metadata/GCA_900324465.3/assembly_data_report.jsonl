An initial PacBio assembly was made using Falcon-unzip. The primary contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data with scaff10x and mis-joins broken using break10x. After using the PacBio data to gap fill with PBJelly and polish with Arrow, the assembly was polished again using the 10X Illumina data and freebayes. Finally, the assembly was further manually curated using gEVAL to correct mis-joins and improve concordance with the BioNano data and Arima Hi-C data. This was the initial fAnaTes1.1 assembly. An updated fAnaTes1.2 assembly has been further curated to removed duplicate haplotypes using purge_haplotigs and using the Hi-C data to identify further breaks and joins and produce chromosomal-level scaffolds. fAnaTes1.3 includes a mitochondrial assembly produced at The Rockefeller University using mitoVGP. Chromosomes have been named by synteny to medaka.","diploidRole":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_900650485.1"}],"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2021-04-24","submitter":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":25,"contigN50":7055436,"gcCount":"223041235","gcPercent":40.5,"genomeCoverage":"68.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":50,"numberOfContigs":316,"numberOfOrganelles":1,"numberOfScaffolds":50,"scaffoldL50":10,"scaffoldN50":25063394,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":23,"totalSequenceLength":"555641398","totalUngappedLength":"552034902"},"currentAccession":"GCA_900324465.3","organelleInfo":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Wellcome Sanger Institute","totalSeqLength":"17111"}],"organism":{"commonName":"climbing perch","organismName":"Anabas testudineus","taxId":64144},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/OOHO00000000.3","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/OOHO03","wgsProjectAccession":"OOHO03"}}
