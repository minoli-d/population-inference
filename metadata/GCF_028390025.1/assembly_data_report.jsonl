Both species are small, poisonous ground-dwelling frogs, and are unique among frogs in that they produce their own poison rather than obtain it from their food source as is the case in every other poisonous frog species (from Wikipedia entry). The species are critically endangered of becoming extinct. This sample is from a male, bred in captivity, in Melbourne, Australia, as part of the conservation program. This sample was collected by Lee Berger, and the project coordinated by him, Andrew Crawford, Lee Skerratt, Tiffany Kosch, and others, to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D.
