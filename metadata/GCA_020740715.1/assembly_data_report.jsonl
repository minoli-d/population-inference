Its diet consists mainly of seeds and grasses. It is sometimes likened to a tiny kangaroo due to its incredibly large hind legs, and hopping form of locomotion (from Wikipedia). This sample was collected from an adult male by Kimberly Cooper at the University of California, San Diego USA, and used to generate a high-quality trio-based reference genome assembly for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). The parent samples are named mJacJac2 (mother) and mJacJac3 (father). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the by Gene Myers' group at Max Planck Institute, Dresden, and coordinated by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis at the Rockefeller University.","organism":{"organismName":"Jaculus jaculus","taxId":51337},"title":"Animal sample from Jaculus jaculus (Lesser Egyptian jerboa) for VGP genome mJacJac1"},"devStage":"Adult","geoLocName":"USA: San Diego","isolate":"mJacJac1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-23T18:59:24.427","latLon":"32.72 N 117.17 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2021-07-25T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Jaculus jaculus (Lesser Egyptian jerboa) for VGP genome mJacJac1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18705814"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2021-07-25T16:18:04.587"},"submissionDate":"2021-07-25T16:18:04.587","tissue":"liver, spleen"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_020740715.1","diploidRole":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_020740685.1"}],"releaseDate":"2021-11-03","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II CLR 101X; 10X Gemonics linked reads 78X; Bionano Genomics DLS 182X; Arima Genomics Hi-C v1 60X","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":74,"contigN50":6605917,"gcCount":"1014148580","gcPercent":42.0,"genomeCoverage":"40.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":508,"numberOfContigs":3372,"numberOfScaffolds":508,"scaffoldL50":8,"scaffoldN50":117185741,"totalSequenceLength":"2595216862","totalUngappedLength":"2407126951"},"currentAccession":"GCA_020740715.1","organism":{"commonName":"lesser Egyptian jerboa","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"mJacJac1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Jaculus jaculus","taxId":51337},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAJGSB000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAJGSB01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAJGSB01"}}
