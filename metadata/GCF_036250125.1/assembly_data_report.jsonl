Like other manakins, this species has a fascinating breeding display at a communal lek, with 3-4 males just within earshot of each other. Males fly between horizontal perches with a swooping flight, or, when a female is present, a slow butterfly-like flutter (from Wikipedia entry). This sample from a female caught in Peru by Gleen F. Seeholzer at the American Museum of Natural History, and later coordinated by Jacob Berv at the University of Michigan, was used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Pseudopipra pipra","taxId":415032},"title":"Animal sample from Pseudopipra pipra (White-crowned manakin) for VGP genome, bDixPip1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Peru","isolate":"bDixPip1","lastUpdated":"2024-08-20T00:42:30.890","latLon":"10.38 S 73.8 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-01-14T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Pseudopipra pipra (white-crowned manakin) for VGP genome, bDixPip1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22400393"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-01-14T18:56:04.259"},"submissionDate":"2023-01-14T18:56:04.260","tissue":"muscle"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_036250125.1","pairedAssembly":{"accession":"GCA_036250125.1","onlyGenbank":"chromosome MT","status":"current"},"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2024-01-31","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":32,"contigN50":10447158,"gcCount":"497051053","gcPercent":42.5,"genomeCoverage":"49.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":696,"numberOfContigs":1019,"numberOfScaffolds":696,"scaffoldL50":6,"scaffoldN50":75011098,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":33,"totalSequenceLength":"1165201947","totalUngappedLength":"1165137347"},"currentAccession":"GCF_036250125.1","organism":{"infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bDixPip1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Pseudopipra pipra","taxId":415032},"pairedAccession":"GCA_036250125.1","sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_REFSEQ","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAZAVG000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAZAVG01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAZAVG01"}}
