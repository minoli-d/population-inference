It serves as a model organism for basic and biomedical science, and is one of the most commonly consumed food sources for humans. This trio of samples was collected to create a high-quality reference genome for two haplotypes. The female offspring (bGalGal1) is a cross between a modern broiler breeder mother (bGalGal2) and white Leghorn father (bGalGal3). Breeding and sample collection was conducted by Nick Anthony at the University of Arkansas, in coordination with Wesley Warren, Ron Okimoto, Hans Cheng, and Rachel Hawken. Blood from these samples were used to create high-quality reference genome assemblies of each haplotype, coordinated by Erich Jarvis, Wesley Warren, and Olivier Fedrigo, at the Rockefeller University Vertebrate Genome Lab, as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) and the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC).","organism":{"organismName":"Gallus gallus","taxId":9031},"title":"Animal sample from Gallus gallus (bGalGal3)"},"geoLocName":"USA:Fayetteville, Arkansas","isolate":"bGalGal1","lastUpdated":"2024-08-20T04:05:23.840","latLon":"36.0822 N 94.1719 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Chicken sample for VGP-GRC reference genome child of trio "},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22402101"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2020-09-01T13:51:06.392"},"submissionDate":"2020-09-01T13:51:06.390","tissue":"Blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_016700215.2","comments":"Contigs JAENSL010000510-JAENSL010000685 were added to the assembly in September 2021.
