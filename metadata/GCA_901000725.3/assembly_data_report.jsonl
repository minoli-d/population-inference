An initial PacBio assembly was made using Falcon-unzip, and retained haplotigs were identified using purge_haplotigs. The primary contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data with scaff10x, then scaffolded further with BioNano hybrid scaffolding and scaffolded further still using the Hi-C data with SALSA2. Polishing and gap-filling of both the primary scaffolds and haplotigs was performed using the PacBio reads and Arrow, followed by two rounds of Illumina polishing using the 10X data and freebayes. The mitochondrial assembly was produced at The Rockefeller University using mitoVGP. Finally, the assembly was manually improved using gEVAL to correct mis-joins and improve concordance with the BioNano and Hi-C data. Chromosome-scale scaffolds are named by synteny to the GCA_000180615.2 assembly of Takifugu rubripes.","diploidRole":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_901000745.3"}],"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2021-04-24","submitter":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":35,"contigN50":3136617,"gcCount":"173725323","gcPercent":45.5,"genomeCoverage":"83.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":127,"numberOfContigs":529,"numberOfOrganelles":1,"numberOfScaffolds":127,"scaffoldL50":10,"scaffoldN50":16705553,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":22,"totalSequenceLength":"384110215","totalUngappedLength":"380421686"},"currentAccession":"GCA_901000725.3","organelleInfo":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Wellcome Sanger Institute","totalSeqLength":"16448"}],"organism":{"commonName":"torafugu","organismName":"Takifugu rubripes","taxId":31033},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CAAJGN000000000.3","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CAAJGN03","wgsProjectAccession":"CAAJGN03"}}
