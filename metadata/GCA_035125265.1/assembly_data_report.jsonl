It is a terrestrial species, living in the undergrowth and smaller than some other members of the Boidae family (modified from Wikipedia source). This sample is from a female bred in captivity at the Ophidian Research Colony, at the University of Texas at Tyler, coordinated and processed by Anne Bronikowski of Iowa State University, and used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Candoia aspera","taxId":51853},"title":"Animal sample from Candoia aspera (viper boa) for VGP reference genome, rCanAsp1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Ophidian Research Colony, at University of Texas at Tyler","isolate":"rCanAsp1","lastUpdated":"2024-08-19T15:36:21.047","latLon":"32.3163 N 95.2510 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-08-28T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Candoia aspera (viper boa) for VGP reference genome, rCanAsp1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22397789"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-08-28T01:14:04.923"},"submissionDate":"2023-08-28T01:14:04.923","tissue":"liver"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_035125265.1","diploidRole":"haplotype_1","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_2","linkedAssembly":"GCA_035149785.1"}],"releaseDate":"2024-01-05","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":10,"contigN50":49525232,"gcCount":"628024830","gcPercent":41.0,"genomeCoverage":"37.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":180,"numberOfContigs":279,"numberOfScaffolds":180,"scaffoldL50":3,"scaffoldN50":209784440,"totalSequenceLength":"1529331567","totalUngappedLength":"1529311767"},"currentAccession":"GCA_035125265.1","organism":{"infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"rCanAsp1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Candoia aspera","taxId":51853},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAYKKY000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAYKKY01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAYKKY01"}}
