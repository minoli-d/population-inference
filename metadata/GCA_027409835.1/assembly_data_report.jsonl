The chub mackerel has a well-developed swim bladder attached with the esophagus, which the \"true mackerels\" in the genus Scomber lack (from Wikipedia entry). This sample is from a male collected by JinGu Kim and Chul Lee in coastal waters off of South Korea, and coordinated by Chul Lee and Heebal Kim with funding from the Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries to generate a high-quality reference for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D.
