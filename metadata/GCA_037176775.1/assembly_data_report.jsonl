The species is native to Cuba and the Bahamas. It has been widely introduced elsewhere, via the importation and exportation of plants where the anole would lay eggs in the soil of the pots, and is now found in Florida and as far north in the United States as southern Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Hawaii, and Southern California. It has also been introduced to other Caribbean islands, Mexico, and Taiwan. This sample of a male subadult individual found in Palm Coast, Florida was procured by Tonia Schwartz and coordinated by Anne Bronikowski to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genome Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Erich D. Jarvis, Giulio Formenti, and Jennifer Balacco.","organism":{"organismName":"Anolis sagrei","taxId":38937},"title":"Animal sample from Anolis sagrei (brown anole lizard) for VGP reference genome, rAnoSag1"},"devStage":"subadult","geoLocName":"USA: Palm Coast, Florida","isolate":"rAnoSag1","lastUpdated":"2024-08-07T14:07:02.252","latLon":"29.582251 N 81.214912 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2024-02-26T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Anolis sagrei (brown anole lizard) for VGP reference genome, rAnoSag1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22178101"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2024-02-26T21:17:05.454"},"submissionDate":"2024-02-26T21:17:05.453","tissue":"blood, liver"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_037176775.1","diploidRole":"paternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"maternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_037176765.1"}],"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":14,"contigN50":40158202,"gcCount":"708256196","gcPercent":41.0,"genomeCoverage":"39.4x","numberOfComponentSequences":41,"numberOfContigs":213,"numberOfScaffolds":41,"scaffoldL50":3,"scaffoldN50":274775750,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":13,"totalSequenceLength":"1727284250","totalUngappedLength":"1727249850"},"currentAccession":"GCA_037176775.1","organism":{"commonName":"Brown anole","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"rAnoSag1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Anolis sagrei","taxId":38937},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JBBBDP000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JBBBDP01","wgsProjectAccession":"JBBBDP01"}}
