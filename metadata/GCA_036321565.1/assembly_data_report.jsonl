It is remarkable for its adaptations to arid environments and has been integral to human societies in these regions. This sample (mCamDro1) is from a male bred at Mr. Shabat bin Saqar Al-Muraikhi camel breeding farm, in Qatar. Samples were also obtained from parents (father mCamDro2 and mother mCamDro3). These samples were collected and coordinated by Farooq Omar Al-Ajli (Katara Biodiversity Genomes Program), to create trio-based high-quality assemblies of the maternal and paternal haplotypes for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) and Qatar Biodiversity Genomes Project (QBGP). Sequencing was done at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis. Genome assembly was conducted at Sidra Medicine by Farooq Omar Al-Ajli and Khalid A. Fakhro in collaboration with VGL.","organism":{"organismName":"Camelus dromedarius","taxId":9838},"title":"Animal sample from Camelus dromedarius (Arabian camel) for VGP genome, mCamDro1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Qatar: Mr. Shabat bin Saqar Al-Muraikhi camel breeding farm","isolate":"mCamDro1","lastUpdated":"2024-07-30T09:26:21.607","latLon":"25.27881495 N 51.50256842 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2024-01-08T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Camelus dromedarius (Arabian camel) for VGP reference genome, mCamDro1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22165637"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2024-01-08T13:22:04.414"},"submissionDate":"2024-01-08T13:22:04.413","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_036321565.1","diploidRole":"maternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"paternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_036321535.1"}],"releaseDate":"2024-01-31","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Dovetail OmniC","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":21,"contigN50":28900355,"gcCount":"871035595","gcPercent":41.5,"genomeCoverage":"39.4x","numberOfComponentSequences":173,"numberOfContigs":383,"numberOfScaffolds":173,"scaffoldL50":12,"scaffoldN50":70331411,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":36,"totalSequenceLength":"2086495379","totalUngappedLength":"2086453379"},"currentAccession":"GCA_036321565.1","organism":{"commonName":"Arabian camel","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"mCamDro1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Camelus dromedarius","taxId":9838},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAZARV000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAZARV01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAZARV01"}}
