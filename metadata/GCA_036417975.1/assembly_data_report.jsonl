It is the most common kiwi. It holds the world's record for laying the largest eggs relative to its body size (modified from Wikipedia entry). This sample of male was collected by the veterinary team at the Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute, and coordinated by Klaus-Peter Koepfli to be used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Erich D. Jarvis, Giulio Formenti, and Jennifer Balacco.","organism":{"organismName":"Apteryx mantelli","taxId":2696672},"title":"Animal sample from Apteryx mantelli (North Island brown kiwi) for VGP reference genome, bAptMan1"},"devStage":"juvenile","geoLocName":"USA: Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute, Front Royal, VA","isolate":"bAptMan1","lastUpdated":"2024-07-25T23:43:21.240","latLon":"38.887667 N 78.165167 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2024-01-04T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Apteryx mantelli (North Island brown kiwi) for VGP reference genome, bAptMan1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22136747"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2024-01-04T14:47:06.952"},"submissionDate":"2024-01-04T14:47:06.953","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_036417975.1","diploidRole":"haplotype_2","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_1","linkedAssembly":"GCA_036417845.1"}],"releaseDate":"2024-02-06","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":29,"contigN50":15312369,"gcCount":"707758246","gcPercent":44.5,"genomeCoverage":"48.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":349,"numberOfContigs":504,"numberOfScaffolds":349,"scaffoldL50":6,"scaffoldN50":88126246,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":43,"totalSequenceLength":"1593539360","totalUngappedLength":"1593508360"},"currentAccession":"GCA_036417975.1","organism":{"commonName":"North Island brown kiwi","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bAptMan1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Apteryx mantelli","taxId":2696672},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAYMGR000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAYMGR01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAYMGR01"}}
