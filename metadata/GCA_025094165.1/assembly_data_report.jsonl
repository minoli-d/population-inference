Sometimes known as the \"dense-beaked whale,\" this species is typically found in deep, offshore, tropical to temperate waters worldwide (NOAA website). The tissue sample from a stranded male was sent from Hubbs SeaWorld Research Institute in Orlando, Florida to San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance (SDZWA) in 2011 in order to establish a cell line that could be banked in SDZWA's Frozen Zoo. The sample was cultured and frozen by the SDZWA Frozen Zoo Cell Culture Team and later provided to generate a high-quality reference for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.
