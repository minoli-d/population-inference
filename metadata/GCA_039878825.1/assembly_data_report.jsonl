This species is the smallest \"true quail\", ranging in the wild from southern China, South and Southeast Asia to Oceania, south to southeastern Australia, with 9 different subspecies (modified from Wikipedia entry). A recent revised taxonomic species name is Excalfactoria chinensis. This sample of a male individual was sourced and collected from a laboratory colony at Stanford University by Jessica Nowicki, Dave Ramirez, and Lauren O'Connell to generate a high-quality reference genome for a neuroscience project and the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genome Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Erich D. Jarvis, Giulio Formenti, and Jennifer Balacco.","organism":{"organismName":"Excalfactoria chinensis","taxId":46218},"title":"Animal sample from Coturnix chinensis (blue-breasted quail) for VGP reference genome, bCotChi1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Palo Alto, California","isolate":"bCotChi1","lastUpdated":"2024-07-30T09:16:32.863","latLon":"37.4275 N 122.1697 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2024-05-07T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Coturnix chinensis (blue-breasted quail) for VGP reference genome, bCotChi1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22165628"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2024-05-07T18:19:04.693"},"submissionDate":"2024-05-07T18:19:04.693","tissue":"heart, liver"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_039878825.1","diploidRole":"haplotype_2","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_1","linkedAssembly":"GCA_039878515.1"}],"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2024-05-31","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":33,"contigN50":7816141,"gcCount":"402543554","gcPercent":41.5,"genomeCoverage":"52.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":191,"numberOfContigs":521,"numberOfScaffolds":191,"scaffoldL50":4,"scaffoldN50":86361526,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":33,"totalSequenceLength":"966847183","totalUngappedLength":"966783983"},"currentAccession":"GCA_039878825.1","organism":{"commonName":"Chinese painted quail","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bCotChi1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Excalfactoria chinensis","taxId":46218},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JBDMBA000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JBDMBA01","wgsProjectAccession":"JBDMBA01"}}
