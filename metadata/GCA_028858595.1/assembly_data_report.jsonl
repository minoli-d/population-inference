It is an endangered species. Along with the sandhill crane (Antigone canadensis), it is one of only two crane species native to North America (from Wikipedia entry). This sample (bGruAme1) is from a male of a trio of samples, with the parents (mother bGruAme2 and father bGruAme3) collected as eggs in Alberta Canada, and the child (aDenEbr1) breed in captivity at the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Blood sample collection as by Barry Kinney Hartup at the International Crane Foundation. Use of the samples were coordinated by Hernan Eduardo Morales Villegas and Tom Gilbert in Copenhagen, Denmark, for a trio-based high-quality reference genome of both maternal and paternal haplotypes, and contributed to the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Grus americana","taxId":9117},"title":"Animal sample from Grus americana (whooping crane) for VGP genome, bGruAme1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Baraboo, Wisconsin","isolate":"bGruAme1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-22T14:16:19.353","latLon":"43.5477 N 89.7563 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-01-17T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Grus americana (whooping crane) for VGP genome, bGruAme1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18688455"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-01-17T23:24:04.678"},"submissionDate":"2023-01-17T23:24:04.677","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_028858595.1","diploidRole":"paternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"maternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_028858705.1"}],"releaseDate":"2023-02-24","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II CLR; 10X Gemonics linked reads; Arima Hi-C v1; Bionano DLS","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":49,"contigN50":7082157,"gcCount":"507477005","gcPercent":42.5,"genomeCoverage":"232.6x","numberOfComponentSequences":395,"numberOfContigs":979,"numberOfScaffolds":395,"scaffoldL50":5,"scaffoldN50":81581678,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":37,"totalSequenceLength":"1200805165","totalUngappedLength":"1194813280"},"currentAccession":"GCA_028858595.1","organism":{"commonName":"Whooping crane","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bGruAme1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Grus americana","taxId":9117},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JARBUR000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JARBUR01","wgsProjectAccession":"JARBUR01"}}
