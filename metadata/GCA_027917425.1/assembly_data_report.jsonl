It inhabits southern Maryland to the Florida Keys, west to Missouri and Texas (from Wikipedia entry). This sample is from an animal (unknown sex) at the Amphibian Conservation Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia, collected by Craig Hassapakis, coordinated by Andrew Crawford, Bob Murphy, and Spencer Livermore, and used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, lead by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D.
