The species breeds in Tasmania during the summer and migrates north to south eastern mainland Australia from Griffith-Warialda in New South Wales and west to Adelaide in the winter. It is a nomadic migrant, and it settles in an area only when there is food available. The species is critically endangered, and the severe predation of introduced sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) on breeding females and nests in some locations has demonstrated an unexpected but potentially serious new threat (from Wikipedia entry). This sample of a female adult individual found in North Bruny, Tasmania, Australia, was procured by Manuel Schweizer, Tom Gilbert, and Hernan Morales to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genome Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Erich D. Jarvis, Giulio Formenti, and Jennifer Balacco.","organism":{"organismName":"Lathamus discolor","taxId":678569},"title":"Animal sample from Lathamus discolor (swift parrot) for VGP reference genome, bLatDis1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Australia: North Bruny, Tasmania","isolate":"bLatDis1","lastUpdated":"2024-07-30T11:51:22.883","latLon":"43.164424 S 147.319128 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2024-03-06T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Lathamus discolor (swift parrot) for VGP reference genome, bLatDis1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22167509"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2024-03-06T22:36:05.393"},"submissionDate":"2024-03-06T22:36:05.393","tissue":"blood, muscle"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_037157625.1","diploidRole":"haplotype_2","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_1","linkedAssembly":"GCA_037157495.1"}],"releaseDate":"2024-03-15","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Arima Hi-C v2; Bionano DLS","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":14,"contigN50":25138706,"gcCount":"479343869","gcPercent":43.0,"genomeCoverage":"31.4x","numberOfComponentSequences":413,"numberOfContigs":535,"numberOfScaffolds":413,"scaffoldL50":4,"scaffoldN50":129024758,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":24,"totalSequenceLength":"1123412812","totalUngappedLength":"1120560631"},"currentAccession":"GCA_037157625.1","organism":{"commonName":"Swift parrot","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bLatDis1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Lathamus discolor","taxId":678569},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JBBBVO000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JBBBVO01","wgsProjectAccession":"JBBBVO01"}}
