They roosts in caves, abandoned mines, rock crevices, buildings, and tropical moist forest. This sample is from a male in Guilin City, China, collected by Libiao Zhang, sequenced by Jianguo Luo's group at Sun Yat-sen University in China, assembled at the Vertebrate Genome Lab at the Rockefeller University in New York led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis' group, and curated by Sanger Institute curation team in England led by Kerstin Howe. The genome was generated for the purpose of being freely used for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pandemic studies, and as a Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) reference. The original sample was thought to be the Chinese horseshoe bat, but sequencing determined it to be another known sample collected (Hipposideros larvatus).","organism":{"organismName":"Hipposideros larvatus","taxId":175524},"title":"Animal sample from Hipposideros larvatus (intermediate roundleaf bat) for VGP genome, mHipLar1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"China: Guilin City, Guangxi Province","isolate":"mHipLar1","lastUpdated":"2023-07-03T23:27:04.483","latLon":"25.17717498 N 110.34114361 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-07-03T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Hipposideros larvatus (intermediate roundleaf bat) for VGP genome, mHipLar1"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-07-03T23:27:04.483"},"submissionDate":"2023-07-03T23:27:04.483","tissue":"muscle"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_031876335.1","diploidRole":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_031878685.1"}],"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2023-09-25","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Bionano DLS; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":23,"contigN50":34562834,"gcCount":"971712609","gcPercent":41.5,"genomeCoverage":"30.5x","numberOfComponentSequences":69,"numberOfContigs":188,"numberOfScaffolds":69,"scaffoldL50":6,"scaffoldN50":185549907,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":18,"totalSequenceLength":"2338923724","totalUngappedLength":"2338890320"},"currentAccession":"GCA_031876335.1","organism":{"infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"mHipLar1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Hipposideros larvatus","taxId":175524},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAVKSA000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAVKSA01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAVKSA01"}}
