The assembly process included the following sequence of steps: HiFi reads were trio-binned using trioCanu with k-mers from the Illumina-sequenced parents; haplotype-specific HiFi reads were assembled separately using Hifiasm; segregation of HiC reads using Canu's 'splitHaplotype' script and k-mers from the Illumina-sequenced parents; for each haplotype assembly, haplotype-specific and unclassified HiC reads were combined to construct scaffolds using pins. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHifi. Finally, the assembly was analysed and manually improved using gEVAL. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data have been named in order of size.","releaseDate":"2022-02-01","submitter":"Wellcome Sanger Institute"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":68,"contigN50":8948077,"gcCount":"754774718","gcPercent":40.0,"genomeCoverage":"61.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":1517,"numberOfContigs":1992,"numberOfScaffolds":1517,"scaffoldL50":12,"scaffoldN50":42286699,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":60,"totalSequenceLength":"1882648115","totalUngappedLength":"1882553115"},"currentAccession":"GCA_902713435.2","organism":{"commonName":"sterlet","organismName":"Acipenser ruthenus","taxId":7906},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CACTIF000000000.2","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CACTIF02","wgsProjectAccession":"CACTIF02"}}
