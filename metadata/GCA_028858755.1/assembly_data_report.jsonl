It is a member of the large group of neotropical parrots known as macaws. This sample is from a male at the Texas A&M's Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center, born in Hill Country Aviaries in Dripping Springs, Texas, collected by Sharman Hoppes, coordinated by Janice Boyd (deceased) and Taylor Hains at the University of Chicago, and used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Ara ararauna","taxId":9226},"title":"Animal sample from Ara ararauna (blue-and-gold macaw) for VGP genome, bAraAra1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Dripping Springs, Texas","isolate":"bAraAra1","lastUpdated":"2023-02-03T18:31:04.432","latLon":"30.25717885 N 98.09274949 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-02-03T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Ara ararauna (blue-and-gold macaw) for VGP genome, bAraAra1"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-02-03T18:31:04.432"},"submissionDate":"2023-02-03T18:31:04.432","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_028858755.1","comments":"Both haplotypes were curated, but haplotype 1 is more complete","diploidRole":"haplotype_1","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_2","linkedAssembly":"GCA_028858555.1"}],"refseqCategory":"reference genome","releaseDate":"2023-02-24","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Bionano DLS; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":10,"contigN50":38811057,"gcCount":"522232038","gcPercent":42.5,"genomeCoverage":"39.0x","numberOfComponentSequences":246,"numberOfContigs":353,"numberOfScaffolds":246,"scaffoldL50":5,"scaffoldN50":110438430,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":35,"totalSequenceLength":"1224360198","totalUngappedLength":"1223372069"},"currentAccession":"GCA_028858755.1","organism":{"commonName":"blue-and-yellow macaw","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bAraAra1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Ara ararauna","taxId":9226},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAQZCJ000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAQZCJ01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAQZCJ01"}}
