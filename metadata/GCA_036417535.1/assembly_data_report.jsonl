It is native to the desert and steppe regions of Asia, west from the Sinai Peninsula extending across Kazakhstan east to Mongolia. This sample (bChlMac1) is from a female, bred at the Rawdat Al Faras Houbara Breeding Center, in Qatar. Samples were also obtained from the parents (mother bChlMac3 and father bChlMac2). These samples were collected and coordinated by Farooq Omar Al-Ajli (Katara Biodiversity Genomes Program), to create trio-based high-quality assemblies of the maternal and paternal haplotypes for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) and Qatar Biodiversity Genomes Project (QBGP). Sequencing was done at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis. Genome assembly was conducted at Sidra Medicine by Farooq Omar Al-Ajli and Khalid A. Fakhro in collaboration with VGL.","organism":{"organismName":"Chlamydotis macqueenii","taxId":187382},"title":"Animal sample from Chlamydotis macqueenii (MacQueen's bustard) for VGP genome, bChlMac1"},"devStage":"juvenile","geoLocName":"Qatar: Rawdat Al Faras Houbara Breeding Center","isolate":"bChlMac1","lastUpdated":"2024-07-25T23:13:21.743","latLon":"25.82191 N 51.33107 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2024-01-08T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Chlamydotis macqueenii (MacQueen's bustard) for VGP genome, bChlMac1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22136710"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2024-01-08T13:23:05.111"},"submissionDate":"2024-01-08T13:23:05.110","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_036417535.1","diploidRole":"maternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"paternal_haplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_036418225.1"}],"releaseDate":"2024-02-07","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Dovetail OmniC","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":10,"contigN50":25335467,"gcCount":"550956425","gcPercent":43.0,"genomeCoverage":"51.9x","numberOfComponentSequences":328,"numberOfContigs":428,"numberOfOrganelles":1,"numberOfScaffolds":328,"scaffoldL50":5,"scaffoldN50":84623986,"totalNumberOfChromosomes":38,"totalSequenceLength":"1273916401","totalUngappedLength":"1273896401"},"currentAccession":"GCA_036417535.1","organelleInfo":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project","totalSeqLength":"16918"}],"organism":{"commonName":"Macqueen's bustard","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bChlMac1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Chlamydotis macqueenii","taxId":187382},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAZAQN000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAZAQN01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAZAQN01"}}
