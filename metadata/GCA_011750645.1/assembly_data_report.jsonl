Native to Northern Africa, this diurnal rodent has a diet primarily of leaves and stems, supplemented with insects, seeds, and fruits. However, when maintained in a laboratory environment with a rodent chow diet that has high caloric content relative to its native diet, both sexes rapidly develop diet-induced diabetes. By mimicking the disease etiology, the Nile rat provides an important animal model to study the causality of type 2 diabetes and is a suitable pre-clinical model. These samples were collected from a male and his parents in a laboratory colony of Huishi Toh and James Thomson at University of California, Santa Barbara, and used to generate chromosomal level reference assembly as part of the G10K-VGP project.","organism":{"organismName":"Arvicanthis niloticus","taxId":61156},"title":"Animal sample from Arvicanthis niloticus"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"USA: Santa Barbara","isolate":"mArvNil1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-23T11:08:19.267","latLon":"34.41938 N 119.69905 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2019-08-20T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Nile rat tissue for G10K-VGP trio reference genome child"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18698935"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-08-20T19:29:05.309"},"submissionDate":"2019-08-20T19:29:05.307","tissue":"Spleen (genome), brain & testis (transcriptome)"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_011750645.1","comments":"This assembly represents the maternal haplotype of the diploid genome Arvicanthis niloticus.
