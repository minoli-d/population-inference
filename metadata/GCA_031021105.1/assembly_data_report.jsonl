This species is endemic to northern South America, and is non-venomous. This sample was collected by Valeria Ramirez Castaneda in the Rebecca D. Tarvin Lab at UC Berkley, from a female in Southern Colombia, in an Amazon forest area, and used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Erythrolamprus reginae","taxId":121349},"title":"Animal sample from Erythrolamprus reginae (royal ground snake) for VGP genome, rEryReg1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Colombia: Leticia, Amazonas, Reserva Natural Tanimboca","isolate":"rEryReg1","lastUpdated":"2023-01-07T23:39:03.861","latLon":"4.12 S 69.95 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2023-01-07T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Erythrolamprus reginae (royal ground snake) for VGP genome, rEryReg1"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-01-07T23:39:03.861"},"submissionDate":"2023-01-07T23:39:03.861","tissue":"kidney"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_031021105.1","comments":"GenomeScope analyses indicates this individual is a triploid (model fits p=3); smudgeplot results in a proposed triploid, with a strong AAB signal. The Hifiasm + Hi-C process resulted in hap1 and hap2+3 assemblies, with hap2+3 having two copies of the genome based on QC metrics, while hap1 having one un-duplicated copy of the genome. This is supported by largely unduplicated BUSCO results, a largely 1 copy kmer-cn spectrum, and the length of the assembly being near to the expected genome size based on the triploid genomescope model. The hap1 assembly was scaffolded with Hi-C data using YAHS, and is what we are submitting for annotation. The hap2+3 assembly was purged with purge_dups, resulting in a purged hap2 only assembly and a remaining hap3 assembly, but were difficult to scaffold.
