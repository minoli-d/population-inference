Young birds lack the red forehead and sexes are similar in appearance. This species is distinguished from the yellow-fronted tinkerbird by the color of the forehead spot, the golden wing patch, and its overall darker appearance. It is often confused with the red-fronted barbet, but it is significantly smaller than that species, has a black mustache and a less robust bill, and lacks a broad yellow superciliary stripe.","organism":{"organismName":"Pogoniulus pusillus","taxId":488313},"title":"Model organism or animal sample from Pogoniulus pusillus"},"devStage":"Adult","geoLocName":"Eswatini","isolate":"bPogPus1","lastUpdated":"2023-08-23T20:00:22.483","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2020-06-04T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"bPogPus1_blood"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18706227"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2020-06-04T07:05:03.914"},"submissionDate":"2020-06-04T07:05:03.913","tissue":"Blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_015220175.1","diploidRole":"alternate_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"principal_pseudohaplotype_of_diploid","linkedAssembly":"GCA_015220805.1"}],"releaseDate":"2020-11-02","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel I CLR; Illumina NovaSeq; Arima Genomics Hi-C; Bionano Genomics DLS","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":486,"contigN50":647387,"gcCount":"508095504","gcPercent":46.0,"genomeCoverage":"165.4x","numberOfComponentSequences":2748,"numberOfContigs":2760,"numberOfScaffolds":2748,"scaffoldL50":486,"scaffoldN50":647387,"totalSequenceLength":"1101771457","totalUngappedLength":"1101769231"},"currentAccession":"GCA_015220175.1","organism":{"commonName":"Red-fronted tinkerbird","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"bPogPus1","sex":"female"},"organismName":"Pogoniulus pusillus","taxId":488313},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JADCQL000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JADCQL01","wgsProjectAccession":"JADCQL01"}}
