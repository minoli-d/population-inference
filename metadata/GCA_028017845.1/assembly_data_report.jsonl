This sample is from a female at a Nature Reserve in Italy, collected by Claudio Ciofi, to generate a high-quality reference for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the University of Florence in Italy led by Ciofi and the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis, with support from Ciofi and Jarvis.","organism":{"organismName":"Emys orbicularis","taxId":82168},"title":"Animal sample from Emys orbicularis (European pond turtle) for VGP genome rEmyOrb1"},"devStage":"adult","geoLocName":"Italy: Reserve Naturale Monte Rufeno","isolate":"rEmyOrb1","lastUpdated":"2024-07-10T09:54:33.259","latLon":"42.78473 N 11.88612 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publicationDate":"2022-11-20T00:00:00.000","sampleIds":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Emys orbicularis (European pond turtle) for VGP genome rEmyOrb1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18701668"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2022-11-20T13:55:04.152"},"submissionDate":"2022-11-20T13:55:04.150","tissue":"blood"},"blastUrl":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROG_DEF=blastn&BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_028017845.1","diploidRole":"haplotype_2","linkedAssemblies":[{"assemblyType":"haplotype_1","linkedAssembly":"GCA_028017835.1"}],"releaseDate":"2023-01-26","sequencingTech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Bionano DLS; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assemblyStats":{"contigL50":14,"contigN50":54020573,"gcCount":"1040191793","gcPercent":45.0,"genomeCoverage":"30.1x","numberOfComponentSequences":156,"numberOfContigs":286,"numberOfScaffolds":156,"scaffoldL50":5,"scaffoldN50":135176522,"totalSequenceLength":"2327425914","totalUngappedLength":"2322138075"},"currentAccession":"GCA_028017845.1","organism":{"commonName":"European pond turtle","infraspecificNames":{"isolate":"rEmyOrb1","sex":"male"},"organismName":"Emys orbicularis","taxId":82168},"sourceDatabase":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgsInfo":{"masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAQMCV000000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAQMCV01","wgsProjectAccession":"JAQMCV01"}}
